## Why?

- Why not? JavaScript is fun! (I bet nobody said that with a straight face 10 years ago!)

## Why vue.js?

- DOM manipulation in JavaScript is a chore.
- I have experience with *AngularJS* and *React*, but never tried *Vue*
- Vue is gaining a lot of traction these days, so I wanted to see what all the fuss is about.
- Vue is supposed to be really light and minimal.
